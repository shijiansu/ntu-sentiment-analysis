1. Test of Normality (figure 4-8, table 11)
data source: view_engagement
Analyze -> Descriptive Statistics -> Explore
Dependent List = engagement
Factor List = facebook_group
Plots 
-> un-select: Stem-and-leaf
-> select: Histogram
-> select: Normality plots with tests (important)
>> Result is not Normality

data source: view_engagement
Analyze -> Correlate -> Bivariate
Variables = engagement, count_of_like, count_of_comment, count_of_share, count_of_comment_like
un-select: Pearson (this is only for Normality)
select: Spearman

data source: view_engagement_1 ~ view_engagement_5 
Analyze -> Correlate -> Distances
Variables = engagement, count_of_like, count_of_comment, count_of_share, count_of_comment_like
select: Between variables
select: Dissimilarities
select Measures: Euclidean distance

4. Correlate engagement, like with count of word, is_pic (table 18)
